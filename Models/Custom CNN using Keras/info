Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using Keras' Sequential API.

The model used is a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using Keras' Sequential API. This model is designed for binary image classification to detect if an image contains a knife or not.

By adding more convolutional layers and using max pooling, the model can learn more complex features, which improves its ability to distinguish between images with and without knives.
