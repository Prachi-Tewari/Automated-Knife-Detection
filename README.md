### Project Overview: Automated Knife Detection in Surveillance Images

This project focuses on enhancing security systems by developing an automated knife detection model using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The primary objective is to accurately identify knives in surveillance images, thereby improving real-time threat detection capabilities.

We curated a comprehensive dataset of approximately 16,000 images, meticulously categorized into knife and non-knife classes. Unlike traditional models like YOLO that require extensive annotated datasets, this project leverages a tailored CNN specifically designed for binary classification. The model effectively distinguishes between the presence and absence of knives, ensuring high precision and recall rates.

Key highlights of the project include:
- **Custom CNN Architecture:** Designed to capture intricate features specific to knives, the model's architecture includes convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and a final dense layer for binary classification.
- **Dataset:** A balanced and carefully curated dataset consisting of 16,000 images, split into knife and non-knife categories, was used to train the model.
- **Model Performance:** The model demonstrated high accuracy in detecting knives, validated through metrics like confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.
- **Real-time Application:** This model is optimized for integration into existing surveillance systems, enabling real-time threat detection to enhance public safety.

This project represents a significant step forward in automated weapon detection, offering a reliable solution that can be seamlessly incorporated into modern surveillance frameworks.
